## Requirements

The experiments were validated on **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**, and should work on **Ubuntu 22.04 or later** (and generally on recent Linux distributions).  
On Ubuntu, the following packages are required:

- `bash`
- `docker-ce` (tested with version 28.3.3)
- `docker-compose-plugin` (tested with version v2.39.1)
- `git`
- `make`

You can install them with:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y bash docker-ce docker-compose-plugin git make
