# This script automates the process of running the experiments.
# It performs the following steps:
# 1. Builds the Docker environment.
# 2. Prepares the data sources (Postgres, Parquet).
# 3. Runs all individual Python scripts to generate experiment data for each figure.
# 4. Runs the plotter script to generate PDF plots and copies all results.
#
# The script will exit immediately if any command fails.
